# SISGameJam2024

Internal Game Jam at Snowed In Studios. Built off the [Kenney FPS Starter Kit](https://github.com/KenneyNL/Starter-Kit-FPS?tab=readme-ov-file) in Godot.

## Themes
Unfaithful Adaptation, Very Very Fast. These are the top 2 themes from the voting.

## Gameplay
Starts off as Pikmin-like: plucking new Pikmin and throwing them to pellets to create more at the onion. After a period of time, the player suddenly equips a gun, high-octane metal music starts playing, and the Pikmin suddenly become autonomous and hell-bent on killing you. They swarm you in large numbers, and you must mow them down to survive.

As the game progresses, the Pikmin's health and numbers increase, and the guns could periodically update.

## Art
I am on the fence between ripping a Pikmin model, attempting one myself, or conning Cedric into working on one for me. They will likely remain un-rigged and will just be used staticly.

Gun will be low-poly, likely a blaster model provided by Kenney.

## Music
Start with free music, if there's time or if I need a break I might play with something like Soundation studio to quickly put together a lazy composition with loops to make it slightly less lazy than free music.
